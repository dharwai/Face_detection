Both files on github,
videos flaskappp and working2 
are the same working scenrio.. one for laptop and other for pc i tried.
thats why two folders

first you need to creat a folder ,
as i created the folder name videosflask and its location is on desktop.
inside the videoflask2 folder i created a file videolask.ipynp (jupyter note book file)
and also i created two folders in side the videoflask folder, names templates and temporary and in side the templates i created index.html and result.html.


so now summary:
in videoflask folder you have 1 file of python, one model.h5,and two morw folers. templates and temporary.
